			<h2>Addons</h2>
			<p>
				Addons are unique because they are personal and everyone can choose his or her own UI, but we can agree that there are addons that are a MUST for every player. So here are 10 of the must-have addons in World of Warcraft for any type of player regardless of your main priorities – Raider, Farmer, Pvper.
			</p>
			<ul class="link1">
				<li><a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/skada">Skada</a>
					<p>We couldn’t imagine playing WoW without knowing what our performance is. Whether it’s healing or tanking or dpsing. Skada or Recount is the top tool and a must-have addon. It measures DPS, Healing, Damage Taken and it has the ability to produce graphs, scales and pie charts and is able to go into the very detail of your combat performance</p>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/deadly-boss-mods">DBM ( deadly boss mod )</a>
					<p>Deadly Boss Mods or DBM is the most downloaded and most widely used addon out there. To current date it has more than 157 million downloads ranking it the top addon in the world. It provides raiding, dungeon and PVP information of the instance you are in and what cooldown timers the current encounter has.</p>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/omni-cc">OmniCC</a>
					<p>OmniCC is a simple addon but the game still relies on it since the in-game version is thin at most. It provides a beautiful cooldown timer on your action bar buttons. That’s it! Ingenious and invaluable.</p>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/postal">Postal</a>
					<p>Postal is a simple but invaluable addon. It gives some functionality to your otherwise ineffective mailbox. It automatically autocompletes alts and characters from your friendlist so you don’t have to type manually and the most important feature -> There is a Open All button which makes this addon an absolute MUST</p>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/altoholic">Altoholic</a>
					<p>Now this is an addon that you cannot live without. Everyone has an alt. Even if it’s not a fighting alt, it is a bank alt. Forget about logging off, logging in with one of your alts to search for this cloth or ore. You can now do it from Altoholic. Altoholic adds who else of your characters has this item when hovered and adds it as a tooltip. It also has an auction house-like interface which allows you to search for items, achievements, dungeon progress, collective gold, total played time and so much more. A trully must-have addon</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="link2">
				<li><a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/npcscan">NPCScan</a>
					<p>Although NPCScan has been greatly nerfed in the 6.X patches in Draenor due to mechanic of caching monsters, NPCScan is still, to date in Legion, invaluable addon to track down Rares. It also has the ability to show spawn locations and lists of all rares in the zone. You can also add custom NPCs to the addon so you are alerted when near/clicking.</p>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bartender4">Bartender4</a>
					<p>Bartender4 is a full ActionBar replacement mod. It provides you with all the features needed to fully customize most aspects of your action and related bars.</p>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/grid">Grid</a>
					<p>The compact grid of units lets you select a group member quickly, while keeping a good overview of the whole group. Grid is designed to show you only what you need to know, and not overload you with irrelevant information. It is highly configurable, letting you choose exactly what is shown, and how it's shown. There are also many plugins that add even more features!</p>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon">Bagnon</a>
					<p>Bagnon is a very popular addon. I personally, don’t want my bags split but all of my friends do and use this addon. Extremely popular</p>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/quartz">Quartz</a>
					<p>Quartz is a casting bar. A bar showing the swings between autoattacks, spell casting, DoT timers and anything reallly that requires some kind of time checking. Quartz is everything you need.</p>
